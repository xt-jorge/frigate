A complete and local NVR designed for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) with AI object detection. Uses OpenCV and Tensorflow to perform realtime object detection locally for IP cameras.

Use of a GPU or AI accelerator is highly recommended. AI accelerators will outperform even the best CPUs with very little overhead. See Frigate's supported [object detectors](https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/object_detectors/).

- Tight integration with Home Assistant via a [custom component](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate-hass-integration)
- Designed to minimize resource use and maximize performance by only looking for objects when and where it is necessary
- Leverages multiprocessing heavily with an emphasis on realtime over processing every frame
- Uses a very low overhead motion detection to determine where to run object detection
- Object detection with TensorFlow runs in separate processes for maximum FPS
- Communicates over MQTT for easy integration into other systems
- Records video with retention settings based on detected objects
- 24/7 recording
- Re-streaming via RTSP to reduce the number of connections to your camera
- WebRTC & MSE support for low-latency live view

## Sentinel source integration

This fork publishes `occupancy_frames` for existing configured `detect.occupancy_zones`.
Each frame includes its original capture time, dimensions, inference coverage clipped
to image pixels, current raw detections, and the existing native tracker inventory.
The `regions` entries carry the existing zone name, contour bounds, and continuity
uncertainty; the consumer requires the commissioned zone name and geometry together.

Normal stationary tracker seeds retain their original detector clocks. After a
confirmed overlapping track disappears, the existing stationary-motion classifier
checks its occupied image footprint. Whole-box overlap follows the existing contour,
and persisting sub-patches keep uncertainty during partial occlusion. Changed occupied
pixels plus current complete negative inference can recover without a full vehicle
trajectory. Rejected candidates use the configured native disappearance budget;
incomplete coverage or replayed frames cannot turn their absence into fresh clearance.
Contained footprints coalesce across reacquisition. The 64-footprint resource limit
logs saturation and keeps the affected zone unknown until source or calibration recovery.

Current non-false-positive tracks publish through the existing `events` channel at a
bounded 0.5-second heartbeat, including cameras without occupancy zones. Coasting
old-frame geometry does not trigger presence updates, and heartbeat publication does
not refresh detector or OCR capture times. The current-frame LPR scheduler continues
real OCR for stationary vehicles at most once per track every two seconds, inside its
existing camera/global attempt budgets. Both former five-second stationary cutoffs
are removed; cached plate text never becomes a new OCR capture.
